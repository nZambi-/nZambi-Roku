# Project nZambi-Roku

This project was started at the end of 2018 as a replacement for the recently forked Emby-Roku Client. It is built on the Roku V2 user interface programming API, Roku SceneGraph (RSG) and BrightScript Scripting Language. It is intended to be a General Client for Jellyfin Server.

## Installation

As of this writing, Installation is not even recommended... We are Very Early in the development of this thing and it is a bit of a mess...

## History

tl;dr: I want to be a part of a Community with a commitment to OSS. I watched the First Emby Forks and joined the conversation which became Jellyfin. The Emby-Roku app needs a re-write so I started this project.

Having spent a lot of time with Plex (PlexPass Subscriber) I began to become dissatisfied with how closed the project had become. I still believe that Plex is a great server, but after a Roku Client (closed source) update that angered a great many users was pushed out, and the feeling of not being heard by the Developers I decided to give Emby a second look. This was nearing the end of 2018 and Emby had just started to Close some of their code. I was watching the three main forks that grew from the last Open Emby code as they came together and became Jellyfin.  I had spent just enough time in the Emby Forums to see firsthand the disrespect shown there towards proponents of OSS which led me abandon Emby all together and pitch in with Jellyfin.

Iâ€™m a Roku User. I put in some time getting the Client that the Jellyfin team forked from emby to work for me, but it is Full of depreciated Roku SDK Code and I thought that a near re-write would be the best course of action.
